Hello! I am currently a Data Visualization Engieer at Atorus Research, acting primarily as an R Package developer for the package [`admiral`](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/index.html). I grew up in San Francisco, received my Statistics B.S. from UCLA and my Biostatistics M.S. from Columbia University. In my spare time, I like to swim and watch movies. I also LOVE baseball and basketball, you could catch me rooting for the Giants and Warriors any day of the year. Welcome and thank you for visiting!
