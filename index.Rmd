Hello! I am currently a biostatistics M.S. candidate at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and a research assistant in the Department of Mental Health Data Science at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. I grew up in San Francisco and went to college at UCLA, majoring in statistics and minoring in mathematics. In my spare time, I like to swim and watch movies. I also LOVE baseball and basketball, you could catch me rooting for the Giants and Warriors any day of the year. Welcome and thank you for visiting!
